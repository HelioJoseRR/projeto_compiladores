## ✅ Tasks Completed

### 1. Project Organization ✅

**Files Deleted (7 items):**
- `__pycache__/` (root directory cache)
- `armv7_errors.txt` (old error log)
- `new_armv7_errors.txt` (old error log)  
- `ARM_FIXES_SUMMARY.txt` (obsolete summary)
- `gui.c` (test file, not part of project)
- `gui.exe` (test executable)
- `output.s` (generated assembly output)

**Files Moved (12 items):**
- `calc_server.minipar`, `calc_client.minipar` → `examples/`
- 6 documentation files → `docs/reports/`
- 4 archive files → `docs/archive/`

**Directory Structure:**
```
projeto_compiladores/
├── src/          (12 Python modules)
├── examples/     (18 Minipar programs)
├── tests/        (6 test files)
├── docs/
│   ├── reports/     (6 technical reports)

│   └── tutorials/   (user guides)
├── bin/          (utility scripts)
└── (root files)  (11 essential files)
```

### 2. Updated .gitignore ✅

Added comprehensive ignore patterns:
- `output.*` - All generated output files
- `*.exe`, `*.o`, `*.s`, `*.asm` - Compiled/generated files
- `test_*.minipar` - Temporary test files
- `debug_*.py` - Debug scripts
- Enhanced Python cache patterns

### 3. Bugs Fixed ✅

- **Status:** ✅ Fixed and tested

**Bug #2: Input Type Inference**  
- **File:** `src/c_codegen.py`
- **Issue:** Input variables incorrectly typed
- **Fix:** Usage-based type inference
- **Status:** ✅ Previously fixed, verified working

### 4. Comprehensive Testing ✅

**All Tests Passed:**
- ✅ ex1.minipar - Basic functionality
- ✅ ex3.minipar - Input handling
- ✅ ex5.minipar - Loops
- ✅ fatorial_rec.minipar - Recursion
- ✅ Test suite - All tests pass
- ✅ Runner - No encoding errors
